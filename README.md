## Hi there, I'm Veronica 👋

Hello! I'm Veronica and im 27 years old. I'm just finished my first year in school for front-end developer. I'm a passionate front-end developer student with a love for creating beautiful and user-friendly websites. I study in crafting responsive and engaging web experiences using the latest technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 😄 About me
My journey in web development began with a strong interest in creating visually appealing and functional websites. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects in school, from small personal websites to bigger applications. I'm constantly learning and exploring new techniques to improve my skills and stay updated with industry trends. My skills are HTML, CSS and Javascript.

When I'm not coding, you can find me in the nature with my dog or out enjoying life with good friends. I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working in teams to bring ideas to life. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss any projects. I'm always open to new opportunities and eager to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts. Let's create something amazing together!"

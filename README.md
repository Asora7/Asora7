# 👋 Hi, I'm Veronica

I'm a 27-year-old front-end developer student currently finishing my second year at Noroff. I’m passionate about creating beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites using modern tools like React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

## 📚 About Me

My journey in web development started with a love for design and functionality. I’ve since built a variety of school projects – from small responsive websites to full-fledged booking systems and auction platforms. I’m always curious, constantly learning, and love turning ideas into interactive web experiences.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me hiking with my dog or spending time with friends. I love working in teams.
